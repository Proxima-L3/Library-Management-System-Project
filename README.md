<h2>Description:</h2>

A simple "library management system" console program written in javascript. 


<h2>Goals/Purpose:</h2>

- Learn a second programming language
- Learn JavaScript exclusively through documentation (learned a framework via 
documentation in last project; learning a language entirely from 
documentation is meant to increase my confidence in my self-teaching 
abilities and my ability to use "primary resources" as opposed to "easier", 
more beginner friendly resources like third-party articles and video lectures)
- Practice exclusively using a simple text editor and a command line 
interpreter/shell (as opposed to an IDE that has built in features that make 
building a program significantly easier)
- Practice using Sublime text editor for larger projects
- Learn how to use the Bash Unix shell and all its most important commands
- Get practice using/interacting with git/github through shell commands 
instead of built in vcs features in IDEs like VSCode and PyCharm
- Ensure that I properly understand the object oriented programming paradigm 
(being able to make an OOP program in another language would demonstrate and 
reaffirm that I had indeed, previously gained a sufficient understanding of 
the most important underlying concepts of OOP)
- Learn about basic standard practices of JavaScript
- Practice/learn about documenting my code in JavaScript
- Practice actually using exception handling throughout a program (previously 
avoided exception handling because a lack of understanding of its importance)
- Practice/learn about modular programming in JavaScript
- Learn about and begin writing tests for my programs
- Learn about concurrency, parallelism, multithreading, and multiprocessing 
concepts and how to implement them (maybe write part of the program in python 
to get a good sense of the critcal universal ideas)
